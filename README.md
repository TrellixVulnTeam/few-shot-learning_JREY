# Few Shot Learning

The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class.
Here, I explored the power of One-Shot Learning with a popular network called "**Siamese Neural Network**".
