# Few Shot Learning

The hipes in Deep Learning is centered around the fact that we have cleanly labelled dataset with lots and lots of training dataset. In real world –that's not the case. Also, if I you've never seen a bannana before and I show you one single picture of a bannana –you're very likely when shown another image containing bannana to say *That's a bannana*. This is not the case with Deep Learning as we need to show them a few thousands or even millions of bannana for them to be able to guess with good accuracy.

Here, I explored the power of One-Shot Learning with a popular network called **"Siamese Neural Network"**.
